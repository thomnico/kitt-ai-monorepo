# KITT Framework - GitHub Configurations

This directory contains GitHub-specific configurations for the KITT voice assistant framework, including workflows for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD).

## Overview

The .github directory holds configuration files for GitHub Actions to automate testing, building, and deployment processes for the KITT framework monorepo. These workflows ensure code quality, run tests, and facilitate deployment across different platforms.

## Implementation Guidelines

- **Purpose**: Automates development workflows using GitHub Actions.
- **Scope**: Includes workflows for linting, testing, building, and deploying Android, iOS, and API components.
- **Integration**: Designed to work with the monorepo structure managed by Yarn workspaces or Turborepo.

## Development Steps

1. Create workflow files for automated testing of shared packages and platform-specific apps.
2. Set up build pipelines for Android and iOS applications.
3. Configure deployment scripts for pushing updates to respective app stores or backend services.
4. Ensure workflows are triggered on appropriate events like push or pull requests.

For detailed implementation guidelines and CI/CD setup instructions, refer to the main documentation in the `docs/` directory at the root of the monorepo.

# KITT Framework - Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the KITT voice assistant framework, covering architecture, implementation details, and development guidelines.

## Overview

The docs directory serves as the central repository for all documentation related to the KITT framework monorepo. It includes detailed information on design decisions, platform-specific implementations, offline synchronization strategies, AI model integration, and developer guidelines to ensure a consistent and informed development process.

## Documentation Scope

- **Architecture Overview**: High-level design decisions and system architecture of the KITT framework.
- **Platform-Specific Details**: Implementation notes for Android (Kotlin) and iOS (Swift) native apps.
- **Offline Synchronization**: Strategies for local-first data handling and conflict resolution with Supabase.
- **AI Model Integration**: Techniques for integrating and optimizing Kyutai Moshi and Gemma models for on-device use.
- **Developer Guidelines**: Setup instructions, contribution guidelines, and best practices for working within the monorepo.

## Development Steps

1. Document the overall architecture and key design decisions for the framework.
2. Provide detailed guides for setting up development environments for Android, iOS, and backend components.
3. Outline synchronization mechanisms and conflict resolution strategies for offline-first capabilities.
4. Describe optimization techniques for AI model inference and resource management.
5. Maintain up-to-date contribution guidelines to facilitate collaboration within the team.

This documentation is essential for understanding the KITT framework's structure and for guiding development across platforms. Developers should regularly update and refer to these documents to ensure alignment with the project's goals and standards.

# KITT Framework - Tools

This directory contains build and development tools for the KITT voice assistant framework, designed to support the monorepo's development workflow.

## Overview

The tools directory includes scripts, configurations, and utilities that aid in building, testing, and deploying the KITT framework across platforms. These tools help automate repetitive tasks, ensure consistency in development practices, and streamline the CI/CD process.

## Implementation Guidelines

- **Purpose**: Provides utilities for build automation, code generation, and other development tasks.
- **Scope**: Covers tools for dependency management, testing, linting, and deployment preparation.
- **Integration**: Designed to work with Yarn workspaces or Turborepo for monorepo management.

## Development Steps

1. Develop scripts for common tasks like building shared packages or running tests across workspaces.
2. Configure tools for code formatting and linting to maintain code quality.
3. Create utilities for generating boilerplate code or documentation.
4. Ensure tools are compatible with the CI/CD pipeline configurations in the `.github/` directory.

For detailed implementation guidelines and usage instructions for specific tools, refer to the main documentation in the `docs/` directory at the root of the monorepo.

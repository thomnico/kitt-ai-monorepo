**Status:** DRAFT

## Introduction

The KITT Framework monorepo hosts a complex, cross-platform conversational AI system designed for automotive environments. To maintain consistency, scalability, and collaboration across Android, iOS, API, and shared packages, we adhere to the following coding guidelines. These rules are inspired by recognized software engineering practices from industry leaders and experts like Andy Burkov, focusing on pragmatic, disciplined approaches rather than hype-driven trends.

## 1. Code Organization and Structure

- **Modular Design**: Organize the repository into clear domains to isolate services and shared libraries. Follow the existing structure:
  - `/apps/android-native/` for Android Kotlin app
  - `/apps/ios-native/` for iOS Swift app
  - `/apps/api/` for Supabase Edge Functions
  - `/packages/shared-core/` for business logic (TypeScript)
  - `/packages/ai-models/` for AI model integrations
  - `/packages/data-sync/` for offline-first sync engine
  - `/packages/voice-engine/` for voice processing utilities
  - `/packages/ui-components/` for shared UI components
- **Avoid Tight Coupling**: Ensure microservices and components within the monorepo do not depend on each other's internal implementations. Use published APIs or event-driven communication for inter-service interactions.
- **Atomic Changes**: Support cross-project updates in a single commit when necessary (e.g., updating a shared library in `/packages/` and its consumers in `/apps/` simultaneously).

## 2. Dependency Management

- **Centralized Versioning**: Use a single lockfile (via Yarn Workspaces or PNPM) to manage dependency versions across all projects in the monorepo, preventing version drift.
- **Internal Packages**: Treat shared utilities as versioned packages. For example, a `@kitt/utils` library should be versioned and imported like an external dependency.
- **Selective Builds**: Configure CI/CD pipelines to rebuild and test only the projects affected by a change, using tools like Nx or Turborepo to optimize build times.

## 3. Collaboration and Workflow

- **Trunk-Based Development**: Work in short-lived branches off the `main` branch, merging changes daily to minimize integration debt. Use feature flags to hide incomplete or in-progress features.
- **Access Controls**: Restrict deployment permissions based on team roles. For instance, only backend engineers should deploy changes to `/apps/api/`, while mobile developers manage `/apps/android-native/` and `/apps/ios-native/`.
- **Documentation**: Maintain detailed documentation in `/docs/` and a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file at the root of the monorepo. Include conventions for commit messages, code style, and dependency update protocols.

## 4. CI/CD Optimization

- **Caching**: Implement build and test artifact caching (using tools like Turborepo or Lerna) to skip redundant workflows and speed up CI/CD processes.
- **Parallel Pipelines**: Run tests for independent services concurrently. For example, tests for Android and iOS apps can execute in parallel if no shared code in `/packages/` has changed.
- **Merge Queues**: Use merge queues to sequence merges to `main`, ensuring atomic changes are validated in order and preventing conflicting deployments.

## 5. Tooling and Automation

- **Enforced Policies**: Integrate linters (e.g., ESLint for TypeScript, Kotlin Lint for Android) and formatters (e.g., Prettier) across the monorepo. Use pre-commit hooks to enforce code consistency before commits are made.
- **Monorepo-Aware Tools**: Adopt tools like Nx or Bazel for task orchestration and distributed computation to manage the complexity of building and testing across multiple projects.

## 6. Commit and Code Review Standards

- **Commit Messages**: Follow a consistent format for commit messages, such as `[Component] Brief description of change` (e.g., `[Voice-Engine] Fix audio latency issue`). Include detailed descriptions in the commit body when necessary.
- **Code Reviews**: Require at least one reviewer for changes to critical components (e.g., `/packages/ai-models/`, `/packages/data-sync/`). Reviews should focus on adherence to these guidelines, code quality, and potential cross-project impacts.

## 7. Testing and Quality Assurance

- **Unit Tests**: Ensure each package and app has comprehensive unit tests covering core functionality. Store tests alongside the code they cover (e.g., in a `/tests/` folder within each project).
- **Integration Tests**: Maintain integration tests for interactions between apps and shared packages, especially for voice processing and data sync features.
- **Automated Testing**: Configure CI pipelines to run tests automatically on every pull request, with results reported back to the PR for visibility.

## 8. Performance and Optimization

- **Latency Goals**: Code with performance in mind, targeting sub-200ms voice response latency as outlined in the PRD. Optimize AI model inference and voice processing in `/packages/ai-models/` and `/packages/voice-engine/`.
- **Resource Constraints**: Be mindful of hardware limitations (e.g., 4GB RAM on target devices like Crosscall Core-Z5). Avoid memory-intensive operations and test on constrained environments.

## 9. Example Workflow

A typical change to the `data-sync` package might follow this process:

1. Create a short-lived branch off `main` named `feature/sync-conflict-resolution`.
2. Update the sync logic in `/packages/data-sync/`.
3. If necessary, update consuming apps in `/apps/android-native/` and `/apps/ios-native/` in the same commit.
4. Run selective tests via CI/CD, testing only `data-sync` and affected apps.
5. Merge the branch to `main` after review, using a merge queue to ensure orderly integration.

## Summary

These guidelines aim to balance flexibility with governance, enabling the KITT Framework team to scale development across multiple platforms and technologies. Key priorities include strict modularity to prevent tight coupling, automated quality checks via linters and CI/CD, and context-aware pipelines that optimize build times. By adhering to trunk-based development, centralized dependency management, and clear documentation, we ensure the monorepo remains a productive environment for all contributors.

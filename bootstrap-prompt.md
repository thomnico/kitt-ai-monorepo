# Prompt for Cline Coding Extension: KITT Framework Monorepo Development

## Project Overview

Create a cross-platform monorepo for the KITT framework - an intelligent voice assistant inspired by Knight Rider that operates on-device using Kyutai and Gemma AI models [1][2][3]. The monorepo should support Android native, iOS native, and a Supabase backend with offline-first capabilities [4][5][6].

## Monorepo Structure

Set up a monorepo with the following structure:

```
kitt-framework/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ apps/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ android/        # Android native app
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ios/            # iOS native app
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ api/            # API functions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ packages/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/         # Cross-platform shared logic
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ai-models/      # AI model integration layer
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui-components/  # Shared UI components (where applicable)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data-sync/      # Offline-first data sync implementation
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ voice/          # Voice processing modules
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tools/              # Build and development tools
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .github/            # GitHub Actions for CI/CD
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/               # Documentation
```

This structure enables efficient code sharing while maintaining platform-specific implementations where needed [7][8][9].

## Core Requirements

### 1. Cross-Platform Support

- Implement native Android development using Kotlin for maximum performance and hardware access [10][11][12]
- Implement native iOS development using Swift and Core ML for Apple's AI frameworks [13][14][15]
- Create shared business logic and data models across platforms [16][17][18]

### 2. AI Model Integration

- Integrate Kyutai's Moshi model for voice interactions using native bindings [19][20][21]
- Integrate Gemma on-device models with proper quantization for mobile constraints [22][23][24]
- Develop a common interface layer to support both AI frameworks with minimal platform-specific code [23][25][26]

### 3. Offline-First Architecture

- Implement a local-first data approach using SQLite with proper sync mechanisms [10][11][27]
- Connect to Supabase backend for remote storage and synchronization [28][29][30]
- Build conflict resolution strategies with last-write-wins or custom merging logic [31][32][33]

## Implementation Guidelines

### Android Implementation

```kotlin
// Example code structure for Android native implementation
class KittVoiceAssistant(context: Context) {
    private val moshiEngine = MoshiEngine.initialize(context)
    private val gemmaLLM = GemmaLLM.initialize(context, modelPath)
    
    fun processVoiceInput(audioData: ByteArray): Flow<AIResponse> {
        // Process with Kyutai Moshi for voice recognition
        // Forward transcribed text to Gemma for response generation
    }
}
```

Ensure the Android implementation leverages the GPU for AI acceleration through OpenCL/Vulkan and properly handles lifecycle events [26][34][23].

### iOS Implementation

```swift
// Example code structure for iOS native implementation
class KittVoiceAssistant {
    private let moshiEngine: MoshiEngine
    private let gemmaModel: MLModel
    
    init() {
        // Initialize Kyutai through native bindings
        // Load Gemma model through Core ML
    }
    
    func processVoiceInput(audioData: Data) -> AsyncStream<AIResponse> {
        // Process with native voice frameworks
        // Generate responses on-device
    }
}
```

Utilize Core ML for efficient model inference and Apple's Neural Engine where available [15][35][36].

### Data Synchronization

```typescript
// Example Supabase synchronization logic
class OfflineFirstSync {
    private localDB: SQLiteDatabase
    private supabaseClient: SupabaseClient
    
    async syncChanges() {
        // Identify local changes since last sync
        // Push changes to Supabase when online
        // Pull remote changes and resolve conflicts
    }
}
```

Implement background synchronization with proper network status monitoring and battery efficiency considerations [27][32][33].

## Development Workflow

1. Set up the monorepo using Yarn workspaces or Turborepo for dependency management [37][38][39]
2. Implement shared code packages first, then platform-specific applications [16][17][18]
3. Create unit and integration tests for each package [39][6][9]
4. Configure CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment [40][37][38]

## AI Model Requirements

- Kyutai Moshi: Optimize for on-device execution with appropriate quantization [19][20][21]
- Gemma: Use 2B parameter model with 4-bit quantization for mobile constraints [22][23][24]
- Storage requirements: Reserve approximately 2-3GB for model files [24][23][19]
- Memory management: Implement efficient loading/unloading strategies [25][24][34]

## Offline-First Data Strategy

1. Use a local SQLite database as the primary source of truth [10][31][32]
2. Queue write operations when offline for later synchronization [28][32][33]
3. Implement optimistic UI updates that show pending changes [27][31][41]
4. Develop a background sync service that operates when the app is active [28][31][32]
5. Handle conflict resolution with configurable strategies [32][33][41]

## Security Considerations

- Implement proper authentication and data encryption [27][29][30]
- Secure AI model files to prevent unauthorized access [24][26][34]
- Handle sensitive voice data with proper privacy controls [19][21][42]

## Performance Optimization

- Optimize AI model inference with proper threading and hardware acceleration [22][23][26]
- Implement efficient data caching and prefetching strategies [10][27][32]
- Monitor and manage battery usage, especially during voice processing and sync operations [23][26][34]

## Documentation Requirements

Generate comprehensive documentation covering:

1. Architecture overview and design decisions [40][38][39]
2. Platform-specific implementation details [16][13][22] 
3. Offline synchronization strategies and conflict resolution [31][32][33]
4. AI model integration and optimization techniques [19][22][24]
5. Developer setup and contribution guidelines [6][9][18]

This monorepo should enable efficient development of a KITT-like assistant across platforms while maintaining performance, reliability, and a seamless user experience regardless of network connectivity [1][2][3].

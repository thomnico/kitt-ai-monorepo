# KITT Framework - Shared Logic

This directory contains the cross-platform shared logic for the KITT voice assistant framework, designed to be used across Android, iOS, and API layers.

## Overview

The shared package includes common business logic and data models that are platform-agnostic, enabling code reuse and consistency across different implementations of the KITT framework. This reduces duplication and ensures that core functionalities behave uniformly regardless of the platform.

## Implementation Guidelines

- **Purpose**: Contains data models, business logic, and utilities that are not specific to any platform.
- **Technology**: Likely to be implemented in TypeScript or a similar language that can be easily integrated into native and web environments.
- **Reusability**: Designed to be imported and used by Android (Kotlin), iOS (Swift), and API (Node.js) components.

## Development Steps

1. Define common data models for the voice assistant's entities (e.g., user commands, AI responses).
2. Implement shared business logic for processing and handling data.
3. Ensure compatibility with platform-specific code through appropriate interfaces or bindings.
4. Create unit tests to validate the logic across different use cases.

For detailed implementation guidelines and architecture decisions, refer to the main documentation in the `docs/` directory at the root of the monorepo.

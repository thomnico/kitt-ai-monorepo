# KITT Framework - Data Sync

This directory contains the offline-first data sync implementation for the KITT voice assistant framework, designed to manage local and remote data synchronization with Supabase.

## Overview

The data-sync package implements a local-first data approach using SQLite as the primary source of truth. It connects to a Supabase backend for remote storage and synchronization, ensuring seamless operation regardless of network connectivity. This package handles conflict resolution, background synchronization, and optimistic UI updates.

## Implementation Guidelines

- **Local Storage**: Uses SQLite for on-device data storage.
- **Remote Sync**: Connects to Supabase for cloud synchronization when online.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Implements strategies like last-write-wins or custom merging logic for data conflicts.
- **Efficiency**: Focuses on battery and network efficiency with background sync operations.

## Example Structure

```typescript
// Example Supabase synchronization logic
class OfflineFirstSync {
    private localDB: SQLiteDatabase
    private supabaseClient: SupabaseClient
    
    async syncChanges() {
        // Identify local changes since last sync
        // Push changes to Supabase when online
        // Pull remote changes and resolve conflicts
    }
}
```

## Development Steps

1. Set up SQLite database schema for local data storage.
2. Implement connection to Supabase for remote synchronization.
3. Develop logic for queuing write operations when offline.
4. Create background sync service with network status monitoring.
5. Implement optimistic UI updates to show pending changes.
6. Define configurable conflict resolution strategies.

For detailed implementation guidelines, synchronization strategies, and conflict resolution approaches, refer to the main documentation in the `docs/` directory at the root of the monorepo.

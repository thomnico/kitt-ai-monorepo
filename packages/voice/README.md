# KITT Framework - Voice Processing

This directory contains the voice processing modules for the KITT voice assistant framework, designed to handle audio input and output across platforms.

## Overview

The voice package manages the capture, processing, and output of audio data for the KITT framework. It integrates with on-device AI models like Kyutai Moshi for voice recognition and interaction, ensuring that voice commands are accurately processed and responses are delivered in a natural manner.

## Implementation Guidelines

- **Audio Capture**: Implements platform-specific audio recording for high-quality input.
- **Processing**: Interfaces with AI models for voice-to-text and text-to-voice conversion.
- **Privacy**: Handles sensitive voice data with proper privacy controls to protect user information.
- **Optimization**: Focuses on low-latency processing to provide real-time interaction.

## Development Steps

1. Implement audio capture mechanisms for Android and iOS, ensuring compatibility with device microphones.
2. Integrate with the ai-models package for voice recognition using Kyutai Moshi.
3. Develop audio output for delivering AI-generated responses.
4. Optimize for performance to minimize latency during voice interactions.
5. Implement privacy controls to secure voice data handling.

For detailed implementation guidelines, privacy considerations, and performance optimizations, refer to the main documentation in the `docs/` directory at the root of the monorepo.

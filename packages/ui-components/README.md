# KITT Framework - UI Components

This directory contains shared UI components for the KITT voice assistant framework, designed to be used across Android and iOS platforms where applicable.

## Overview

The ui-components package provides a set of reusable UI elements tailored for the KITT voice assistant interface. These components aim to maintain a consistent look and feel across different platforms, reducing development effort and ensuring a unified user experience.

## Implementation Guidelines

- **Purpose**: Offers UI components that can be shared between Android and iOS, focusing on visual consistency.
- **Technology**: Likely to be implemented using a cross-platform framework like React Native for maximum reusability, or as design guidelines for native implementation.
- **Customization**: Components should be customizable to adapt to platform-specific design guidelines (Material Design for Android, Human Interface Guidelines for iOS).

## Development Steps

1. Identify common UI elements needed for the voice assistant interface (e.g., voice input buttons, response displays).
2. Implement components with a focus on accessibility and responsiveness.
3. Ensure compatibility with both Android and iOS through testing or native adaptations.
4. Document usage and customization options for each component.

For detailed implementation guidelines and design decisions, refer to the main documentation in the `docs/` directory at the root of the monorepo.

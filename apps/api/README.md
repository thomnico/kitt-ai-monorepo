# KITT Framework - API Functions

This directory contains the API functions for the KITT voice assistant framework, designed to handle backend services and integration with Supabase for data synchronization.

## Overview

The API layer serves as the backend for the KITT framework, facilitating communication between the native mobile apps (Android and iOS) and the Supabase backend. It manages remote storage, synchronization, and other server-side functionalities required for the voice assistant's operation, especially in offline-first scenarios.

## Implementation Guidelines

- **Technology**: Likely to be implemented in Node.js or a similar server-side technology compatible with Supabase.
- **Data Synchronization**: Connects to Supabase for remote storage and implements sync mechanisms for offline-first architecture.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Includes strategies like last-write-wins or custom merging logic for data conflicts during sync.

## Example Structure

```typescript
// Example Supabase synchronization logic
class OfflineFirstSync {
    private localDB: SQLiteDatabase
    private supabaseClient: SupabaseClient
    
    async syncChanges() {
        // Identify local changes since last sync
        // Push changes to Supabase when online
        // Pull remote changes and resolve conflicts
    }
}
```

## Development Steps

1. Set up the API project structure and dependencies.
2. Implement connection and authentication with Supabase.
3. Develop synchronization logic for offline-first data handling.
4. Implement background synchronization with network status monitoring.
5. Ensure security measures for data encryption and user authentication.

For detailed implementation guidelines and architecture decisions, refer to the main documentation in the `docs/` directory at the root of the monorepo.

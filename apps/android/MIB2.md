# Android Auto MIB2 Prompts Markdown File Created

I've created a comprehensive markdown file named `android_auto_mib2_prompts.md` that contains all the Gemini 2.5 Pro prompts from our previous conversation, organized and formatted for easy use.

## File Contents

The markdown file includes:

**Six targeted prompts** covering the main compatibility issues:
- **Manifest Analysis** - For identifying AndroidManifest.xml problems
- **API Level Downgrade** - For safely lowering the Car App API level
- **Host Validator Configuration** - For creating debug-friendly host validation
- **Developer Activation Guide** - For step-by-step troubleshooting
- **Unknown Sources Configuration** - For understanding sideloading requirements
- **Firmware Detection** - For checking MIB2 compatibility

**Usage instructions** explaining how to use the prompts effectively with Gemini 2.5 Pro, including the recommendation to use each prompt as a stand-alone request and work iteratively through the issues.

**Quick reference summary** of the most common fixes to try before diving into the detailed prompts.

The file is ready to use and can be easily shared with your development team or referenced during troubleshooting sessions. Each prompt is designed to provide specific, actionable solutions for the Android Auto MIB2 compatibility challenges you're experiencing.

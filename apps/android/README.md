# KITT Framework - Android App

This directory contains the native Android implementation of the KITT voice assistant framework, developed using Kotlin for maximum performance and hardware access.

## Overview

The Android app integrates on-device AI models (Kyutai Moshi for voice interactions and Gemma for response generation) to provide an intelligent voice assistant experience inspired by Knight Rider. It leverages Android's GPU acceleration through OpenCL/Vulkan for AI model inference and handles lifecycle events for efficient operation.

## Implementation Guidelines

- **Language**: Kotlin
- **AI Integration**: Native bindings for Kyutai Moshi and Gemma models with quantization for mobile constraints.
- **Hardware Acceleration**: Utilize GPU for AI processing.
- **Lifecycle Management**: Properly handle Android lifecycle events to manage resources.

## Example Structure

```kotlin
class KittVoiceAssistant(context: Context) {
    private val moshiEngine = MoshiEngine.initialize(context)
    private val gemmaLLM = GemmaLLM.initialize(context, modelPath)
    
    fun processVoiceInput(audioData: ByteArray): Flow<AIResponse> {
        // Process with Kyutai Moshi for voice recognition
        // Forward transcribed text to Gemma for response generation
    }
}
```

## Development Steps

1. Set up the Android project structure and dependencies.
2. Implement native bindings for AI models.
3. Develop voice input processing and response generation logic.
4. Optimize for performance and battery efficiency.
5. Integrate with the shared data-sync package for offline-first capabilities.

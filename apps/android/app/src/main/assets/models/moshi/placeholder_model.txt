This is a deprecated placeholder file for the Moshi model. The KITT Framework has transitioned to using Vosk for speech recognition. In a production environment, the actual Vosk model files (e.g., vosk-model-small-fr-0.22) should be placed in the 'vosk' directory or downloaded to internal storage for offline use.

For more information on integrating Vosk with the KITT Framework, refer to the documentation in packages/voice/docs/vosk-integration.md.

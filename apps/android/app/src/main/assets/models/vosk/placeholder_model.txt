This is a placeholder file for the Vosk model. In a production environment, the actual Vosk model files (e.g., vosk-model-small-fr-0.22) should be placed in this directory or downloaded to internal storage for offline use.

For more information on integrating Vosk with the KITT Framework, refer to the documentation in packages/voice/docs/vosk-integration.md.

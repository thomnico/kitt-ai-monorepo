# Sherpa-ONNX Model Placeholder

This file serves as a placeholder for documentation purposes. Currently, there are no actual Sherpa-ONNX models integrated into this project in this directory.

Sherpa-ONNX models are intended for use in voice synthesis or recognition tasks for the KITT Assistant app. The integration of Sherpa-ONNX models is pending, and this placeholder will be updated once the models are available and integrated.

For more information on Sherpa-ONNX integration, refer to the documentation in the `packages/voice/docs/sherpa-onnx-integration.md` file.

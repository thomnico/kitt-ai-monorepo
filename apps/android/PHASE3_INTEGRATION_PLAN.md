```

#### 4.3 Performance Testing
```
Metrics to validate:
- Voice response latency < 200ms
- UI frame rate > 30 FPS
- Memory usage < 2GB
- Battery consumption optimization
```

#### 4.4 Device Testing
```
Test on:

### 3.2 Required Dependencies
```gradle
// Voice processing
implementation 'org.vosk:vosk-android:0.3.45'

// Performance monitoring
implementation 'androidx.benchmark:benchmark-junit4:1.1.1'

// Testing
testImplementation 'junit:junit:4.13.2'
androidTestImplementation 'androidx.test.ext:junit:1.1.5'
```

### 3.3 New Components to Create

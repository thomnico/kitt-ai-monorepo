   - Implement SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_IMMERSIVE_STICKY
2. Audio permission handling
   - Request RECORD_AUDIO permission at runtime
   - Handle permission result callbacks
   - Show error message if permission denied
3. Lifecycle management
   - Start KITT systems in onResume()
   - Stop systems in onPause()/onDestroy()
4. Startup animation sequence
   - Fade in title text over 2 seconds
   - Start scanner and spectrum analyzer after 1 second delay
5. Optional startup sound playback

Activity structure:
- onCreate(): Setup UI and check permissions
- onRequestPermissionsResult(): Handle permission response
- onResume()/onPause(): Manage system state
- setupFullScreen(): Configure immersive mode
```

### Phase 4: Polish and Optimization

#### Step 8: Performance Optimization
```
Optimize the application for smooth performance:
1. Custom view optimizations:
   - Use setLayerType(LAYER_TYPE_SOFTWARE, null) for shadow effects
   - Minimize object allocation in onDraw() methods
   - Cache Paint objects and reuse them
   - Use clipRect() to limit drawing areas
2. Audio processing optimization:
   - Use appropriate buffer sizes
   - Implement proper thread management
   - Add error handling for AudioRecord failures
   - Smooth magnitude values to reduce jitter
3. Animation optimization:
   - Use hardware acceleration where possible
   - Optimize ValueAnimator update frequency
   - Implement proper animation lifecycle management

Performance monitoring:
- Test on multiple device types

```

#### Step 9: Error Handling and Edge Cases
```
Implement robust error handling:
1. Audio permission scenarios:
   - Permission denied on first request
   - Permission revoked while app running
   - No microphone available on device
2. Audio processing errors:
   - AudioRecord initialization failure
   - FFT calculation exceptions
   - Thread interruption handling
3. UI edge cases:
   - Screen rotation handling
   - App backgrounding/foregrounding
   - Memory pressure scenarios

Error handling implementation:
- Try-catch blocks around critical operations

```

## Advanced Cline Usage Tips

### Iterative Development with Cline
1. **Start with one component at a time**: Don't ask Cline to build everything at once
2. **Test and refine**: Run each component, then ask Cline to fix issues
3. **Use specific technical language**: Be precise about Android APIs and requirements
4. **Review generated code**: Always check Cline's output for best practices
5. **Ask for explanations**: Use "explain this code" if you need clarification

### Analysis Guidelines
- **Respect .gitignore Exclusions:** When analyzing the repository for code, documentation, or any other purpose, all tools and processes must respect the exclusions defined in the .gitignore files at the root and in subdirectories. This ensures that temporary, system-generated, or otherwise irrelevant files (such as .DS_Store) are not considered during analysis or included in any automated processes.

### Effective Prompting Strategies
```
Good prompt example:
"Fix the KittSpectrumView FFT implementation. The current code throws ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when processing audio data. The issue seems to be in the updateMagnitudes method where we access fftData array. Ensure proper bounds checking and handle cases where buffer size doesn't match FFT size."

Bad prompt example:
"The audio thing doesn't work, fix it."
```

### Code Review and Refinement
After Cline generates code, ask for:
1. **Code review**: "Review this code for Android best practices"
2. **Performance analysis**: "Identify performance bottlenecks in this custom view"
3. **Security check**: "Check this audio recording code for security issues"
4. **Documentation**: "Add comprehensive JavaDoc comments to these classes"

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: Audio Permission Problems
**Symptoms**: App crashes when starting audio capture
**Cline prompt**: 
```
"The app crashes with SecurityException when starting AudioRecord. Review the permission handling code and ensure we're properly checking for RECORD_AUDIO permission before initializing AudioRecord. Add proper error handling and user feedback."
```

### Issue 2: Performance Issues
**Symptoms**: UI lag during audio processing
**Cline prompt**:
```
"The spectrum analyzer causes UI lag. Optimize the audio processing to run on background thread and reduce the frequency of UI updates. Ensure onDraw() method is efficient and doesn't allocate objects."
```

### Issue 3: FFT Calculation Errors
**Symptoms**: FFT throws exceptions or produces incorrect results
**Cline prompt**:
```
"Debug the FFT implementation in KittSpectrumView. The FastFourierTransformer requires power-of-2 array sizes. Ensure audio buffer is properly sized and padded if necessary. Add proper error handling for FFT exceptions."
```

## Final Integration Steps

### Testing Checklist
1. Test on multiple Android versions (API 21+)
2. Test with and without audio permissions
3. Test app backgrounding/foregrounding
4. Test on devices with different screen sizes
5. Test audio processing with various input levels

### Deployment Preparation
1. Add app icons and proper branding
2. Configure ProGuard rules for release build
3. Test release build thoroughly
4. Add proper app store description and screenshots

## Conclusion

This comprehensive guide provides everything needed to use Cline effectively for building the KITT K2000 Android application. The key to success is breaking down the complex project into manageable components and using specific, technical prompts with Cline.

Remember that Cline is most effective when given clear, specific instructions with technical details. Always review and test the generated code, and don't hesitate to ask for refinements or optimizations.

The resulting application will be a fully functional Android app that recreates the iconic KITT interface with modern Android development practices and smooth performance.
